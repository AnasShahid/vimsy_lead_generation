# Phase 4.1 Plan 2 Summary: Leads Tracking Page UI

## What Was Done

### Task 1: Created LeadsPage component
- `client/src/pages/LeadsPage.tsx` — Full page with:
  - Stats bar (5 cards: total, enriched, analyzed, reports ready, outreach sent)
  - Quick filter tabs (All, Enriched, Analyzed, Reported, Outreach Pending)
  - Granular filter dropdowns (enrichment, analysis, report, outreach status + priority)
  - Data table with 10 columns: checkbox, domain, company, contacts, enrichment, analysis, report, outreach, priority, expand
  - Select all by filter, bulk actions (Analyze, Generate Reports)
  - Pagination with page controls
  - Polling via usePolling when active processing detected

### Task 2: Created LeadDetailPanel component
- `client/src/components/leads/LeadDetailPanel.tsx` — 3-column expandable detail:
  - Column 1: Contacts list with name, email, position, seniority, department, confidence, verification status, LinkedIn link
  - Column 2: Analysis summary with health score, priority badge, sub-score bars (performance, security, SEO, availability), vulnerabilities count
  - Column 3: Report actions (view/download/generate), pipeline timeline, tags
  - Action buttons: Analyze, Generate Report, View PDF, Download
  - Loading state while fetching detail

### Task 3: Wired up routing and navigation
- `client/src/App.tsx` — Added /leads route with LeadsPage
- `client/src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx` — Added Leads nav item with Target icon between Reports and Outreach
